## Development

After cloning this repo, run `shards` to pull the *lichess-cr* repo.
*lichess-cr* is specifically for handling piece validation, which we will need to ensure that
the moves being played by the engine are valid, & if not, handle the errors client-side rather than
on lichess' server side.

If you're on VSCode,
`git clone https://gitlab.com/kaelta/lichess-cr.git`

Then add the *lichess-cr* & *cojira* folders to the current workspace. There, now you're a 10x developer! Or something.
